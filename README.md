# üè† Homelab Infrastructure

## The Beginning

My homelab journey started with a Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM - the 16GB version wasn't available yet) that I initially bought as a desktop experiment. It quickly evolved into a server, starting with Pi-hole for network-wide ad blocking. 

The real game-changer for this little powerhouse was discovering [CasaOS](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS). I'm surprised it's not more popular in the homelab community - it provides a gentle introduction to Docker, making container deployment as simple as installing apps on a smartphone. Sure, not every container works perfectly out-of-the-box without manual configuration tweaks, but the learning curve is gentle enough to enjoy self-hosting from day one. 

Currently running 23 containers (everything from Jellyfin to Uptime Kuma and Sonarr) at ~60% RAM utilization, which means it's time to add another Pi 5 - this time with 16GB RAM.

While most homelabs focus on typical self-hosted services, what makes mine unique is the extensive HAM radio and SDR infrastructure - from HackRF One with PortaPack to QRP transceivers and a collection of specialized SDR receivers. This radiocommunication ecosystem will be thoroughly documented in upcoming sections.

The next milestone was building a proper NAS with [FriendlyElec CM3588 NAS Kit](https://www.friendlyelec.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=294) running OpenMediaVault, but that's a story for [JOURNEY.md](./JOURNEY.md) - keeping this README focused on technical details and quick references.
